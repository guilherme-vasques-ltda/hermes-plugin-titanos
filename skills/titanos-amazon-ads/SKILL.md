# Titanos Amazon Ads

Use Titanos MCP for live Amazon Ads data and operations. Diagnose first; separate recommendations from writes.

## Workflow

1. Search once with the exact objective, `domain="amazon-ads"`, and `access="read"` or `"write"`.
2. Execute `recommended_tool` directly with the returned schema; describe only a different alternative.
3. Reuse the chosen tool/schema for repeated report windows or resources in the same conversation.
4. Identify integration/profile only when absent or ambiguous, then pull live state and completed report coverage.
5. Analyze with business context: margin, stock, listing health, Buy Box, and campaign intent.

## Analysis rules

- Report exact spend, sales, ACoS/ROAS, orders, and coverage when available.
- Use TACoS when total product sales are available; do not judge ACoS alone.
- Treat Sponsored Brands awareness differently from direct-response campaigns.
- A `PENDING` or partial report is not zero performance.
- Cross-check major cuts or scale decisions against Seller inventory and listing health.

## Writes

Bid, budget, state, targeting, negative keyword, campaign, or rule changes require explicit approval. Present the exact targets, before/after values, payload, and rollback approach first. Execute small reversible batches and verify by reading the changed resource back.

## Failure handling

Do not loop repeated report or schema failures. Simplify the query, inspect the tool schema, verify account scope and data freshness, then report the exact blocker if it persists.
